Like many Italian firms, Womazing remains a family company, although none of the family members are fashion designers.\n\nWe follow a successful formula, using the services of well-known fashion designers to create our collections. The method has been described by fashion critic Colin McDowell as a form of design co-creation characteristic of a number of Italian prêt-a-porter companies."

The first collection consisted of two coats and a suit, which were copies of Parisian models.\n\nDespite the fact that the founder was a lawyer by training, her family has always been closely associated with sewing (the founder's great-grandmother made clothes for women, and her mother founded a professional school of cutting and sewing). The desire to produce clothes for the masses carried great promise, especially at a time when high fashion still dominated and the market for quality prêt-a-porter simply did not exist.",
